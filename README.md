# DNC Login Jumpy 👨🏻‍💻 

## 🔥 To do:
 The company DNC hired you to create a login webpage from zero to the Jumpy.

 The user interface needs to be simple and intuituve, to the user has no trouble to fill the fields. The webpage needs to have all the assets previously provided on Figma.

 ## 😜 What I've learned working on this project:
 ✅  How to validate inputs before submit them.
 ✅  Create a CPF and Phone mask from zero (without lib)
 ✅  Work with Event listener and Keypress
 ✅  Work with querySelectors

 Hope you enjoy as much as I have! ⭐
